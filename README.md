# timingTrackerTF

Timing sistem design for track and field application.

## How it works

Based on Arduino, it uses two photocells and three NRF2401L+ for the trasmission of the signal.
I used a LCD display to implement a menu that contains different type of function, like using only one 
photocell or both for the intermediate time
